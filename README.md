The aim of this thesis was to investigate the amount of cultural
information encoded in English word embeddings with a specific focus
on food words. Food is a topic with a very strong cultural bias and, for
this reason, it is a good candidate to investigate this phenomenon. The
contributions of this thesis are threefold:
1. A qualitative analysis and comparison of the materials contained
in a pre-existing dataset of food norms for both British English
and Mandarin Chinese. The student visualized the relationships
between the various food norms and performed correlation
analysis.
2. The creation of word embeddings for each food word using two
different algorithms (fastText and word2vec) on three different
corpora: news (Gigaword), encyclopedic information
(WaCypedia), and web data (ukWaC).
3. The prediction of human scores using standard linear regression
models by treating word embeddings as predictors, comparing
results for the various types of embeddings named above.
